## Mission Statement
Provide an education centered around the human experience and purpose of learning

## What Will Make Us Different?
Zeved is creating a textbook designed for the 21st century. Dynamic, fun, animated, responsive, and accessible, with the following features:
* **Real-time and useful feedback**: Most textbooks have end of chapter problems to test students on their proficiency. The answers to these questions are usually in the back of the book with no written-out answers, and these answers are often only provided for the odd questions. Creating a textbook that provides *real-time* feedback would ensure that students are understanding the material. When a student gets a question wrong, they would be provided with useful information (such as where they made a mistake, areas of potential improvement, or references to past lessons that may remedy their knowledge gap).

* **Playful and substantive Interactivity**: Kids like to play. Creating textbooks that allow a child to interact with the content would not only build intuition for the subject, but would allow the child to engage with the material actively, instead of absorbing the material passively. Students would be empowered through simulations or click-and-drag interfaces where students could see how their actions affect a system. Interactivity is an essential characteristic to student engagement - it’s why English teachers implement in-class dramatic readings of Shakespeare - and it’s about time our textbooks reflect that fact.

* **Beautiful and accurate animations**: Some systems are static while others are dynamic, but all textbooks are static. For learning the physics of equilibrium, an image diagram is fine; but learning about the dynamics of a pendulum or the changing values of an electric field could be better learned by watching an animation.

* **Accessible, all-in-one, end-to-end**: Textbooks are text-based. While there are technologies that make textbooks more accessible - such as audio recordings, OpenDyslexia font face, or enlarged text - these solutions often run through third parties. Every feature mentioned here, and the accessibility options, would be seamlessly integrated so *every student can learn how they best learn. Simple as that.*
